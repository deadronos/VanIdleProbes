# Designs Directory

This folder holds design artifacts and architecture sketches for larger features.

Guidelines:
- Store design files under `memory/designs/` using a short unique ID: `DESIGN001-feature-name.md`.
- Check uniqueness across `memory/designs/` and `memory/designs/COMPLETED` before creating a new ID.
- Keep designs focused: include problem statement, high-level architecture, data flow, and acceptance criteria.

Recommended files:
- `memory/designs/DESIGN001-prestige.md` — decisions and acceptance criteria for prestige.
