# Active Context

**Current work focus:**
- Seed the `memory/` folder with core project documents (this task).
- Keep a small, discoverable set of tasks and design artifacts inside `memory/` for future agents and contributors.

**Recent changes:**
- Created the memory-bank instructions and this seed operation (TASK001).

**Next steps:**
1. Use `memory/tasks/_index.md` to track ongoing work.
2. Add design docs to `memory/designs/` for bigger features (prestige, entropy, UI flows).
3. Create tasks for specific implementation work (e.g., add a new unit, adjust tick math, create save persistence).

**Active decisions & considerations:**
- Keep the codebase mostly single-file for experimentation; extract to modules only when complexity makes it warranted.
- Prefer docs and small tasks inside `memory/` so agents can continue work after session resets.
